Git is awesome. However, working on a project with a lot of binary files can be challenging. Especially for non-engineers having to use the git terminal commands. To improve the experience of everybody in your team we developed the Git Locks Manager. A graphical interface to provide a straightforward way of managing the file locks in your repositories.

## :closed_lock_with_key: Get Git Locks Manager
You can download an installer for your operating system from the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/Noxdew/git-locks-manager/releases/latest)

Note that the releases are not signed. This means that you OS might tell you that the developer is untrusted and auto-updates won't work on MacOS.
